/*
 * NGINX Unit 1.31.1
 *
 * NGINX Unit is a lightweight and versatile application runtime that provides the essential components for your web application as a single open-source server: running application code, serving static assets, handling TLS and request routing.   **Important**: Ufnit's API is designed to expose any part of its configuration as an addressable endpoint.  Suppose a JSON object is stored at `/config/listeners/`:   ```json { \"*:8080\": { \"pass\": \"applications/wp_emea_dev\" } } ```  Here, `/config/listeners/_*:8080` and `/config/listeners/_*:8080/pass` are also endpoints.  Generally, object options are addressable by their names, array itemsâ€”by their indexes (`/array/0/`).    **Note**: By default, Unit is configured through a UNIX domain socket. To use this specification with OpenAPI tools interactively, [start](https://unit.nginx.org/howto/source/#source-startup) Unit with a TCP port as the control socket.
